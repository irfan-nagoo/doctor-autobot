The project doctor-auto offers to perform preliminary medical diagnosis of the given symptoms and provides a diagnosis report which includes the probable minor/major diseases and a list of medicines that is used to treat those diseases. This application use Artificial Inteligence (ML) to detect major diseases and uses medicine database to offer cure. If you dont get full diagnosis reponse that is probablly because data is not available in the database. More related symptoms as input provide more accurate disease diagnosis. The diagnosis is purely based on symptoms and doesn't consider other parameters link medical test reports, allergies, past history, age etc. because that data is not available. At least 3 symptoms as inputs are required to indicate a major diease which is configurable though. This application runs on real clinical data extracted from credable sources. The symptom to disease mapping clinical data is extracted from [New York Presbyterian Hospital clinical data](https://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/~friedma/Projects/DiseaseSymptomKB/index.html). The disease to medicine/drug mapping clinical data is motivated by [Journal of Biomedical Semantics](https://jbiomedsem.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13326-016-0110-0) scientific journal.
